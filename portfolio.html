  <h3>  Welcome to my portfolio!</h3>

<p>This website shows my journey as a <b>front-end developer.</b> Here, you will find the websites and designs I created using <b>HTML and CSS.</b>I made this portfolio to share my skills, creativity, and the progress Iâ€™ve made in web development.</p><br>

<p>I enjoy building clean, simple, and beautiful websites. I have also started learning <b>JavaScript</b> to add more features to my designs. Each section in this portfolio is made with care and shows what I have learned so far.</p><br>

<p>This is just the beginning! I will continue to update my portfolio as I grow and learn more.</p>

<p>Thank you for visiting! ðŸ˜Š</p>
